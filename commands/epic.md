## Instructions for Claude

**IMPORTANT - Structured epic planning process**

### Epic Flow

The command has automatic access to git context and GitHub labels (see Context section above).

1. **Immediately**: Request high-level description of the epic from user
2. **Intelligent analysis**: Infer scope, impact, and breakdown automatically
3. **Specific questions**: Only ask critical questions if necessary:
   - Timeline constraints
   - Resource availability
   - Critical dependencies
   - Compliance requirements
4. **Load details**: Read `.claude/details/commands/epic.md` for complete process and templates
5. **Verify GitHub connectivity**: Check authentication in background
6. **Analyze codebase**: Review current architecture
7. **Generate epic specification**: Create comprehensive epic plan
8. **Create epic branch**: Set up dedicated development branch
9. **Mandatory review**: Present plan to user for approval
10. **Label management**: Verify and create necessary labels
11. **Create epic issue**: Create main epic issue in GitHub
12. **Create sub-issues**: Generate related feature/task issues
13. **Link issues**: Connect sub-issues to epic
14. **Flow information**: Guide user on next steps

### Detailed Process

#### 1. Epic Understanding

Immediately ask user for epic description:
```
Describe the major initiative you want to plan. Include:
- What problem does it solve?
- What are the main capabilities needed?
- Are there specific constraints or requirements?
```

#### 2. Intelligent Analysis

Based on user description, automatically determine:
- **Scope**: Affected areas of the codebase
- **Phases**: Logical breakdown of work
- **Dependencies**: Technical and organizational
- **Timeline**: Rough estimation based on complexity
- **Risks**: Potential challenges and mitigation

#### 3. Epic Structure Generation

Create comprehensive epic specification including:

**Epic Overview**:
- Clear description and motivation
- Business value and impact
- Success criteria
- Target completion timeframe

**Phase Breakdown**:
- Phase 1: Foundation work
- Phase 2: Core implementation
- Phase 3: Integration and polish
- Phase 4: Testing and documentation

**Related Issues**:
Generate list of specific issues that compose the epic:
- Each issue should be independent and deliverable
- Issues should follow logical dependency order
- Each issue needs clear acceptance criteria

**Technical Considerations**:
- Architecture changes required
- Database migrations needed
- API changes and versioning
- Breaking changes management
- Backward compatibility strategy

**Dependencies and Risks**:
- External dependencies
- Team dependencies
- Technical risks
- Mitigation strategies

#### 4. Epic Branch Creation

**IMPORTANT**: Create dedicated epic branch for all related work

```bash
# Ensure main branch is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create epic branch
EPIC_BRANCH="epic/<epic-name>"
git checkout -b $EPIC_BRANCH
git push -u origin $EPIC_BRANCH

# This branch will be the base for all epic-related PRs
```

**Branch Strategy**:
- Epic branch: `epic/<epic-name>`
- Feature branches: `feat/issue-<number>-<name>` (based on epic branch)
- PRs for features merge into epic branch
- Final PR merges epic branch into main

#### 5. Label Management

**Before creating issues**, verify and manage labels:

1. **List existing labels**: Already available in context
2. **Identify needed labels**:
   - `epic`: For main epic issue
   - `phase:1`, `phase:2`, etc.: For phase tracking
   - Type labels: `feat`, `refactor`, `docs`, etc.
   - Priority labels: `priority:high`, `priority:critical`, etc.
   - Component labels: Based on affected areas

3. **Create missing labels**:
```bash
gh label create "epic" --description "Epic issue" --color "3E4B9E"
gh label create "phase:1" --description "Phase 1" --color "0E8A16"
# ... create other needed labels
```

#### 6. Create Epic Issue

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[EPIC] <Epic Title>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

  --label "feat,epic-related" \
  --milestone "<milestone-if-any>"
```

#### 8. Link Issues to Epic

After creating all issues, update epic issue to link all related issues:
```bash
# Get all created issue numbers
# Update epic issue body to include links
gh issue edit <epic-number> --body "<updated-body-with-links>"
```

### Integration with Development Flow

**Epic-based Flow**: `/research` (optional) ‚Üí `/epic` ‚Üí `/feat` ‚Üí `/dev` ‚Üí `/review-pr`

**Epic in Context**:
1. **`/research`**: Gather information before epic planning (optional)
2. **`/epic`** (this command): Create comprehensive plan and epic branch
3. **`/feat`**: Create detailed specifications for epic sub-issues (optional, if more detail needed)
4. **`/dev issue#X`**: Implement individual issues targeting epic branch
5. **`/review-pr`**: Review individual PRs into epic branch
6. **Final merge**: Create PR from epic branch to main when complete

### Output to User

**During Planning**:
```
üéØ PLANNING EPIC: <Epic Name>

üìã Epic Scope:
   - Components affected: <list>
   - Estimated phases: <number>
   - Related issues to create: <number>
   - Timeline estimate: <timeframe>

üåø Epic Branch: epic/<epic-name>
   - All feature PRs will target this branch
   - Final PR will merge to main

üìù Epic Specification:
<Present full specification for review>

Approve epic creation? (Y/n)
```

**After Creation**:
```
‚úÖ EPIC CREATED SUCCESSFULLY

üéØ Epic Issue: #<number>
   Title: [EPIC] <Epic Title>
   URL: <github-url>

üåø Development Branch: epic/<epic-name>
   Created and pushed to remote
   Base for all epic-related work

üìã Related Issues Created:
   ‚úÖ #<n1> - <Feature 1>
   ‚úÖ #<n2> - <Feature 2>
   ‚úÖ #<n3> - <Feature 3>
   ... (<total> issues created)

üöÄ Next Steps:

1. Start with first issue:
   /dev issue#<n1>

2. When creating PRs, target the epic branch:
   Base branch: epic/<epic-name>

3. Track progress in epic issue: #<number>

4. When all issues complete, create final PR:
   epic/<epic-name> ‚Üí main

üí° All feature PRs should target epic/<epic-name>, not main
```

### Epic Tracking and Progress

The epic issue serves as central tracking:
- Link to all related issues
- Phase completion status
- Overall progress indicator
- Blockers and dependencies
- Timeline updates

### Considerations

- **Epic size**: Should be substantial but completable (2-8 weeks typical)
- **Issue granularity**: Sub-issues should be 1-5 days each
- **Dependencies**: Order issues to minimize blocking
- **Incremental value**: Plan for incremental delivery if possible
- **Team coordination**: Consider team capacity and availability

### Customization

For project-specific epic templates and processes:
`.claude/details/commands/epic.md`

This file can include:
- Epic template customization
- Required sections
- Approval workflows
- Milestone requirements
- Stakeholder communication
